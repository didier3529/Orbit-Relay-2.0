# Orbit Relay 2.0 Deployment Issues Resolution

This document summarizes the issues encountered during deployment to Vercel and the steps taken to resolve them.

## Issue Summary

The Vercel deployment was failing with TypeScript errors:

1. Missing exports from the core package:
   - `estimateCost`
   - `estimateCostJSON`
   - `getSendablePercentage`

2. Unused imports causing TypeScript warnings (TS6133):
   - `Link` imported but unused in multiple files:
     - `apps/web/src/components/AirdropSelection.tsx`
     - `apps/web/src/components/DecompressPage.tsx`
     - `apps/web/src/components/CostCalculator.tsx`

3. Syntax error in DecompressPage.tsx:
   - Invalid syntax in the object property assignment

## Resolution Steps

### 1. Added Missing Utility Functions for Cost Calculation

Created a new file `packages/core/src/utils/estimateCost.ts` with three utility functions:
- `estimateCost`: Calculates the cost of an airdrop in SOL
- `estimateCostJSON`: Returns the cost estimation as a JSON string
- `getSendablePercentage`: Calculates the percentage of recipients that can be sent tokens with a given SOL balance

### 2. Updated Core Package Exports

Modified `packages/core/src/index.ts` to export the new utility functions:
- Added imports for the new utility functions
- Added the functions to the exports list

### 3. Fixed Unused Imports

Removed unused `Link` imports from:
- `apps/web/src/components/AirdropSelection.tsx`
- `apps/web/src/components/DecompressPage.tsx`
- `apps/web/src/components/CostCalculator.tsx`
- `apps/web/src/components/airdrop-steps/Step4.tsx`

### 4. Fixed Syntax Error in DecompressPage.tsx

Fixed a syntax error related to an object property assignment:
```typescript
// Before (incorrect):
pricePerToken: asset.token_info?.price_info?.price_per_token ||, 0,

// After (corrected):
pricePerToken: asset.token_info?.price_info?.price_per_token || 0,
```

## Verification

After making these changes:
1. The core package build succeeded (blue status in Vercel)
2. The web package build succeeded (blue status in Vercel)
3. The application deployed successfully without TypeScript errors

## Recommendations for Future Development

1. Add TypeScript linting to the CI/CD pipeline to catch these issues earlier
2. Use ESLint with the `no-unused-vars` rule to automatically flag unused imports
3. Standardize the project structure to maintain consistency across packages
4. Consider using a pre-commit hook to run TypeScript checking before code is committed
